# 👋  Hi there


## 🚀 About me


I’m a **Full-Stack Web Developer** that specializes in React applications. I’m a self taught developer. Covid hit, I wanted a change with a better work/life balance. Managing a 50-60hr sales work week, father of  two, and loving on my soon to be fiance. I’d code from 9:30pm - 2:30am and land a full-time developer position in 7months! 

🧑🏻‍💻  I enjoy the **constant learning** and exploring all the new **APIs** and **libraries** that help us developers create **scalable** products **fast.** Enabling us to focus on the **problem** we’re trying to solve. I’m a fan of **Material UI,** and have been having fun with **Tailwind CSS.** I use **Express** for personal projects and **.NET** at work. I was just inspired to **Blog** based on Austin Kleon’s **Show your work** to help other devs. 

🏋🏼‍♂️ Outside of tech, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills and love spending time with the fam. I’m always learning new things to **cook**, geeking out my **desk setup**, **gym**, **family outings** then rest to start all over! 

📚 I also love watching videos and books on personal development and productivity to make our 24hrs count. My favorite ones are **Make Time** by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky, **Atomic Habits** by James Clear and **Show Your Work** by Austin Kleon
