# 👋  Hey there

## 🚀 About me

I’m a self-taught Full-Stack Web Developer that specializes in React applications. Covid hit, and I wanted a change with a better work/life balance. Managing a 50-60hr sales work week, father of  two, and loving fiance. I’d code from 9:30pm - 2:30am and land a full-time developer position in 7months! 

🧑🏻‍💻 I use Typescript, Next.js, Material-UI, Redux Toolkit, and an endless amount of libs based on our company's and client's unique needs.

🏋🏼‍♂️ Outside of tech, family life, husky dad, gym, movies. 

🌱 I’m learning CI/CD and becoming a GitHub Actions Jedi.
